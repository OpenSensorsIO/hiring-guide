# Process
## Pre recruitment Prep ｡◕‿◕｡
Have a clear idea of what you are hiring for.  Be clear on your team goals for 6 months time and write down the main skill sets you will need to get you there.  Make a list of the criteria and prioritise the skill sets and personalities. Where would these people be today in their career? What can you offer them? Research market salaries.  Err on the side of over paying rather than under.  

Important nuance: Hire for strengths they bring that you critically need vs for a lack of weaknesses.  

Create and run the process based on what you need i.e. develop a set of questions based on the criteria you need.

## Procedure
- Create job spec and job related criteria
- When using recruitment agencies for hiring or head hunting. Make clear candidate requirements in particular DBS checked and verified. 
- Market advertised job through various channels to gather the best pool of candidates. 
- Arrange initial phone call interview
- Arrange a face to face interview 
- Offer Job and ensure internal processes are up to speed with onboarding new recruit. 

## Interviews ( ⌒o⌒)人(⌒-⌒ )v
Interviews should include:
- Technical ability (assessed by 2-3 people in both 1-2-1, pairing on problems and panel interviews)
- Personality fit (assessed by at least 2 people in 1-2-1 interviews)
- Get feedback from colleagues (endeavour to have at least 1 person outside of your core team and 1 person they would be directly working with to assess them)
- Have them do 1-2-1s with Yodit 

As you are doing interviews, tell the other interviewers the skills that are critical and the weaknesses that you are willing to live with before the interview so they can use the time wisely.

## References (ｏ・_・)ノ”(ᴗ_ ᴗ。) 
References are more important than interviews.  People bring their best selves to an interview so go overboard on back door and front door references.  References should include telephone based whenever possible, email references are crap, please call them.  Listen for the hesitation in people’s voices and the diplomatic ways they talk about the person, prod and get to the bottom of everything.  People that can’t find current & past teachers, colleagues, managers or customers willing to take a call are a major red flag.

Hiring manager should do references personally, it’s the most important thing you will do.  

## Questions to cover
- Understand what it was like to work for that person
- Ask situational questions e.g. how did the recruit take feedback? 
- Dig for times when things didn’t go well, how did they react?
- Take 1 to 2 critical achievements that the recruit referred to on their CV and figure out if the person is taking credit for something they didn’t have a direct impact on.
