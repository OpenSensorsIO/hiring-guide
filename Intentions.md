# Intentions ( ◠‿◠ )
Recruitment is the hardest task any manager has to carry out and requires active mentoring/coaching to develop and improve the skill.

If you have made a hiring mistake, be brave, own up the mistake and act quickly. Skills gaps can be filled (or topped up by adding people to the team) but personality/attitude gaps are impossible to fix. Remember it is never too early to fire!

In the interview process, it’s perfectly fine to forgo hiring someone that you have doubts about but could potentially be a good candidate than to make a bad hire. Patience is an important skill in recruitment and it is ok to wait for the right person. For important hires, it’s not unusual to interview 30+ people, for normal hires at least 6 decent candidates for each role is the norm.

The following pages are designed to help you navigate the hiring process.
