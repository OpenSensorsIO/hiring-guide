# Red Flags - automatic nos  (´ ͡༎ຶ ͜ʖ ͡༎ຶ )

## The Title Collector (‿ˠ‿)( ͡⚆ ͜ʖ ͡⚆ )(‿ˠ‿)
He left uni 5 years ago and calls himself VP Engineering/Sales/Marketing?
 LOL & Hard pass.  It’s not worth the energy to try to get him to understand what he doesn’t know. 

Title inflation in startups is common, they have no money and throw fake titles around like sweets to entice people to join. They also ruin the person’s career because they have inflated expectations of their next role. Often they have had a fake title but not the real responsibility; if in doubt ask details on how they carried a team’s number, got a team to deliver a project within deadline, managed P&L?  

## The brilliant jerk (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡 ┻━┻
You know the type, talk a lot about ‘saying it like they see it’.  Likes to critique / problem find but have no concrete constructive feedback, tries to engineer conflict. These folks often want to have an argument around semantics and get a hard on baiting people. They are vampires for team morale and will make you lose the will to live trying to manage them 

The best people in our fields get to that level with humility, working diligently over many years on their craft and failing over and over again.  

Guard the psychological safety of your teams like your life depends on it…

Worth watching, [am i a brilliant jerk?](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/emotional-intelligence-software/)

**Typical symptoms**
- Interrupts often, talks the majority of the time. Tries to assert disproportionate dominance within a team.  Are often referred to as mansplainers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- Seems very keen on ensuring you know he is really smart with unnecessary anecdotes.
- Wants to tell you how Uber, Google, Netflix sell/build their product and insists you do the same without reflection or having a clue on how different you are from these companies
- Don’t seem to think that the norms around social interactions applies to them.
- Doesn’t listen to feedback, interview questions testing for coachability can weed these folks out.

Brilliant jerks are usually not brilliant, behind the bluster is a ton of insecurities.  Listen out for lots of ‘I’ in referring to projects/deals they were involved in. 

## The chip on shoulder dude ⁍ੈ٥॒̮⁍ੈ
Often can be spotted making a ton of excuses on why their obvious greatness has not materialised. Answers show no self reflection on how they would do things different in their work/choices

**Typical interactions:**
- They were smarter than their last boss and colleagues
- Failed sales/projects they were involved in? ‘we didn’t have smart enough customers, my engineers/sales people were idiots and I couldn’t convince them to build/talk about the right features’ vs real tangible reflection on how they would do things differently.


## Uninterested in the actual work that needs doing ◕‿-)✌
“I have no interest in Engineering/Sales as a career, but really interested in startups/your culture/strategy/blockchain🙄”   Pass... they are usually quite earnest but you will still have to probably fire them or move them out as the rest of the team will be carrying their load. They will also have very little internal motivation to get better as they are dreaming of being somewhere else. 

Startups need people to build the product, sell the product or make it smooth for the business to operate. People who want to ‘do’ strategy without taking responsibility for execution usually have no actual skills ++ an inflated sense of their own intelligence ++ are trying to look cool for their friends 

Hire these folks and your working day will be constantly trying to get them focused motivated to do the basics of the role
